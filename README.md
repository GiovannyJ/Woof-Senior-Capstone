## Inspiration
we made woof bc they said we couldn't do it but we did it swag
## User Stories
- videos and stuff
## Design Choices
### Session manager 
the session manager is cool bc it holds a lot of info that is passed throughout the pages
### Location manager
the location manager is cool for the same reason but with users location data (if they let us have it)
### View/View Model Architecture
we separated views and view models so that we can have design and functionality isolated and that allowed us to work on things at the same time making it more speedy
### Assets
we have multiple assets that we created to import into places, you can use them too if you want
### Types
we have the types separated and modeled directly off of the JSON data so that we can have data consistency
