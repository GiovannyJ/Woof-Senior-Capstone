## Inspiration
Society is enduring a cultural shift; the bond between pets and their owners has never been stronger, with most pet owners considering their pets to be a member of the family. Woof helps pet owners by making it easy to find pet friendly businesses, travel accomodations, and events.
## Features
I can do this
I can do that
I can do this and that
## Design Choices
### Session manager 
the session manager is cool bc it holds a lot of info that is passed throughout the pages
### Location manager
the location manager is cool for the same reason but with users location data (if they let us have it)
### View/View Model Architecture
we separated views and view models so that we can have design and functionality isolated and that allowed us to work on things at the same time making it more speedy
### Assets
we have multiple assets that we created to import into places, you can use them too if you want
### API
we have an api for database connection and making sure data is good in and out swag
## Backend
