In this sprint we will connect all the GET endpoints to the API
- test what the data looks like in API/json_templates/GET
- test what the endpoint data looks like in postman
- create decodable struct in swift (maybe make a separate file for it)
- create method to call endpoint and print it to terminal
- design what skeleton frame will look like and populate data in there using struct
- if all works try making call to API using query strings
- make sure page can refresh to call latest data
- if any errors cannot be solved on swift end its probably an API issue record it

Fixing bugs in API GET endpoints:
- if any errors in API logic for get endpoints are found fix them
- if any endpoints need to be created


Research for 3rd Party API:
- look into documentation for 3rd party API
- look into how to call API and how to best structure data
- look into pipeline: external API -> Script -> Internal API/App itself


Research email Generation:
- how can we send email to user when their account is being breached

Fix pages:
- make sure pages can be traversed
- hold session variables (user account)
