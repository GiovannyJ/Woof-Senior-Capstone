In this sprint we will connect all the GET endpoints to the API
- test what the data looks like in API/json_templates/GET
- test what the endpoint data looks like in postman
- create decodable struct in swift (maybe make a separate file for it)
- create method to call endpoint and print it to terminal
- design what skeleton frame will look like and populate data in there using struct
- if all works try making call to API using query strings
- make sure page can refresh to call latest data
- if any errors cannot be solved on swift end its probably an API issue record it
