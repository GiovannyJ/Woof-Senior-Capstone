progress:
    - over break we fixed completely:
        -register account page
        -profile page
        -events list page
        -update profile page
        -update events page
        -create events page
        -update business page
        -register business page
    -still have some small issues 
        -business full context (is user has more than 1 comment it is not pulling correctly)
    -major issue
        -update event page (when deleting event it doesn't sync with the frontend not sure why API database side is fine tho)

    -most pages are revamped aesthetically

    -Big feature map was added (swag):
        -map added to business full context
        -map being worked on for
            -events list to revamp events page

    -3rd party API:
        -pull yelp data sorts it and sends it to database
        -currently 30 businesses are in database can get more (script scales pretty well im just too lazy to add them all lol)
        -39 failures and 79 successful (~65% success rate) (this is bc some of the text from yelp breaks the SQL)
        -working on making the script more accurate to account for these as well as reducing the number of categories
        -A GREAT FEATURE OF THE YELP API IS THAT IT HAS GEOLOCATION YIPPIE


Things we didn't complete:
    -all map features: very complicated and we are kind of spread thin between working on functionality of the rest of the app vs 1 feature
    - README.md (lol forgot ab this)

plans for next spring:
    -complete map feature
        -event pins on map that will take user to event full context
    -more accurate Yelp API calls
        -gather more diverse data
        -clean data to our liking better
    -finalize frontend designs
    -double triple quadruple check for logical errors
    -README file 


Things we learned:
    -working as a team
    -communication
    -delegating tasks
    -planning code before we write

Things that went wrong:
    -overestimating time
    -little research before diving into some things
