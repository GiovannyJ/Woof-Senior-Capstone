# Layout for backend of Woof
## Requirements
- Golang

### Folders:
- üìÅ database: database driver
- üìÅ json_templates: documentation for shape of data in requests
- üìÅ models: shape of data structs
- üìÅ rest: API routers

### Files:
- üìÑ main.go: main driver of the API

# How to use

## How to run
```
cd API
go run main.go
```

### AUTHENTICATION
Authentication is not yet implemented but, this API will need JWT to interact with for security reasons. Only admins (us swag beasts) have access to token to make requests. This token must be part of the header for each request.

### GET REQUESTS
These are endpoints to retrieve data from the database. They can be queried with parameters and in order of ascending or descending. The endpoints are:
+ [http://localhost:8080/users](#)
  - Retrieve a list of all users.
  - Query parameters available: `userID`, `username`, `email`, `accountType`, `order`
  - ex: http://localhost:8080/users?userID=2 will return all the data for userID = 2 in the database
  
+ [http://localhost:8080/users/#USERID/savedbusinesses](#)
  - Retrieve the list of businesses saved by a specific user.

### Notes
In the future this API may be deployed to my production server as a stand alone service rather than a exe that runs on disc. There may also be attempts to transition this API to a cloud service. This must be done in order to have the API constantly serve data when needed.
