Reason why map wasnt working on local machine:
    -emulator did not have location selected
    -solution: emulator -> features -> location -> select 1

Issue with map view updating
    - when map is in view it needs to constantly update users location (LocationManager.shared.startUpdatingLocation())
    - when map is not in view you need to top this (LocationManager.shared.stopUpdatingLocation())
        - ex in searchView this is done because the constant updating interferes with the view model state
          so the var storing the businesses that are searched disappear
    - need to find more places to do this


Making pins for businesses on map view:
    - using address
    - using geolocation given by the yelp API: ISSUE WAS THERE WAS A SPACE LMAO
        - geolocation should be parsed as 123,123 but it was 2123, 12313 the space is what broke the parsing
        - this was fixed in the backend so now in the database it is stored without a space between

Fixes:
    -map view now works
    -annotations for maps
    -businesses have pins of their location
    -geolocation fix
    -map view is modular (custom view if input vs default user = center)


Future endeavors:
    -clickable pins for each event (clickable that lead to eventFull context)
        - need to make algo that looks at users current location and shows them events within x radius
    -auto complete for user location on: (to ensure that proper geolocation and address are stored in database)
        -business creation
        -event creation
        -business update
        -event update
